Your tissue will not be used for research that involves reproductive cloning. Your tissue or blood samples may be used for research that may lead to the development of new drugs or treatments. The research may be carried out in Academic Institutions, the NHS or commercial companies involved in cancer research in the UK or abroad.\n\nResearch studies accessing samples will be approved and monitored by a review panel of experts. Researchers sign an agreement to limit the use of your donated samples only to the research approved by the panel. Products of that research may be used in later, different research that is in line with the consent you have given. \n\nYou are asked to donate your samples to the biobank for research and will not receive a financial reward either now or in the future.
