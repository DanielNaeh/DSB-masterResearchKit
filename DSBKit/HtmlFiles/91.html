<h3>What are the benefits in taking part?</h3>

<p>
	We cannot promise that the study will help you personally, but the information we obtain will help improve the care and treatment of people with MS.
</p>		
<p>
Research from this study has already contributed to a number of articles published in peer reviewed journals, an updated list of these is always available at blog.msregister.org. This is the best place to keep up to date with the activities of the MS Register.
</p>
<p>	
We send out regular newsletters updating you on the research that the Register is currently undertaking and summaries of the findings so far.

This will not affect the care you receive in any way.

<h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
<p>
If you take part, information that is collected during your visit to the neurology clinic will be anonymised and included on the MS Register. You will also be encouraged to visit the MS Register website to provide your own views and experiences. This information will also be anonymised before it is included.		
</p>
<p>		
Everything that you provide will be safeguarded and protected to ensure your privacy. The anonymous information on the Register will be used to carry out research studies and service planning to help people with MS. The use of anonymously linked datasets is of immense value in chronic health condition research.
