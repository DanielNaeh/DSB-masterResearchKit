<h3>The detail</h3>
<p>
All the information collected by the MS Register is stored on secure servers with the highest levels of encryption. Where you give your consent for us to collect identifiable data, this is stored separately from the clinical data.
</p>

<h3>What do we mean by identifiable information?</h3>
<p>
Identifiable information is that data that specifically identifies you: name, date of birth, gender, postcode and identifying numbers such as NHS Number or a National Insurance number. In the context of the Register such information never forms part of your Register 'record' and will never be published in any format.
</p>
<p>
The identifiable part is used to create an anonymous identifier which we can then use to link to other records, which are also anonymous.
</p>	
<p>
Identifiable information is stored separately from the main Register record in the event that we want to contact you.
</p>
<h3>What do we need from your medical notes?
</h3>
<p>	
Every time you visit your health care professional they keep a record of what happened at that visit. These records are primarily kept on
paper. As computerised systems within
the NHS become more common more data will be held on them, but for the moment the medical notes remain the first document of entry. It's possible that
we will need to have access to these notes to capture some data that is not recorded within a clinical system.
