<h3>What are Health Related Records?</h3>
<p>
These are records from outside of your neurology department that primarily exist on other electronic systems. So examples of these would be MRI scans or data that exists on laboratory systems such as Biochemistry or Haematology. We may also approach your General Practitioner to capture related data from their systems too.
</p>
<h3>What is Data Linkage?</h3>
<p>
Data linkage is the merging of two or more separate data sets (e.g. General Practice information and outpatient data about the same person) for research purposes.
</p>
<p>	
The Register does this by deleting anything identifiable within your neurology record and replacing it with a unique code. Data from any other related clinical records are also anonymised in the same way and replaced with the same code. This code lets us link these records together so we can perform wider analysis. The anonymisation is carried out by a trusted NHS third party so we are unable to re-identify any individuals after this process has been carried out.

<h3>Other MS researchers</h3>
<p>	
It has long been recognised that the lack of information about living with MS in the UK affects both people with MS and the MS research community. It makes sense that the information that we collect via the Register be accessible to more that the Register team.
</p>
<p>	
Should a researcher approach us with appropriate ethical permissions and should they pass the appropriate governance measures that the Register has in place they could be granted access to a small selection of the anonymised data to carry out their own research.
