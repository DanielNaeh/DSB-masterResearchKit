<h3>What will I have to do?</h3>


<p>There are two main ways that you can get involved with the Register:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>By signing the consent form within this pack you can agree to take part in the clinical element of the UK MS Register study. Once you do this your clinician will securely transmit relevant portions of your clinical data to the MS Register.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you, a carer or a member of your family have access to the internet via computer, tablet or smartphone you can also add your experiences to the data collected. If you join up at ukmsregister.org you will be given the opportunity to complete questionnaires covering a variety of topics related to living with MS in the UK today. New questionnaires are added regularly so we will keep in touch with you by email regarding updates.</p></li>
